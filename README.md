# Corner-Grocer
<h1>This is Project 3 for my CS-210 C++ class. </h1>

<h2> The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers. The program that the Corner Grocer is asking you to create should address the following three requirements for a given text-based input file that contains a list of purchased items for a single day: </h2>

1. Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
2. Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
3. Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased. 

I think that the integration between the python code and the C++ code is seamless.
To enhance the code one could add other features that produce either a way to eliminate from the list or a better graphic to represent the number of items purchased. The creation of the frequency.dat file and writing to it had given me some issues until I referenced past modules and figured it out. I think that utilizing two different program languages within the same application is extremely transferrable to other projects. It will allow greater efficiency and security within the application. 
To make this code maintainable and readable I used a generous amount of whitespace also, I added screen clears to tidy the console up in between choices.
